# 25_puzzle_game
I designed and implemented a heuristic-driven search algorithm to solve the 25-puzzle, a complex combinatorial problem that expands upon the classic 15-puzzle. The project's core challenge was navigating an exponentially large state space to find optimal move sequences, demonstrating advanced algorithmic problem-solving and logical reasoning.
